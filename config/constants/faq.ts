    title: "WHAT IS RUSTYFLIP.COM, AND HOW DO THE GAMES WORK?",
    content:
      "RustyFlip is an independent platform where you can use your Rust skins to participate in two exciting games: Coinflip and Jackpot. In Jackpot, any number of players can join by depositing Rust skins into the pot. Your chances of winning are calculated based on the value of the items you deposit—the more you contribute, the higher your chances of taking home the pot. Coinflip is a head-to-head game between two players, with each having a 50% chance of winning. You can bet as little as $0.50, and the winner takes it all.",
